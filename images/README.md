# Image Files

Place your image files here (.jpg, .png, .gif, .webp)

## File Naming

The demo expects:
- `actor-eyes-sample.jpg` - Close-up of actor's eyes for "Guess the Actor"

## Tips

1. Use clear, high-resolution images
2. Crop images to show only the relevant part (e.g., just eyes)
3. Keep file sizes reasonable for fast loading
4. Use descriptive filenames

## Example Structure

```
images/
├── actor-eyes-sample.jpg
├── tom-hanks-eyes.jpg
├── meryl-streep-eyes.jpg
└── logo-quiz-mcdonalds.png
```
